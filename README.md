# ttk4155 - Ping pong game with a distributed embedded control system

Term project in TTK4155: Embedded and Industrial Computer Systems.
This term project aims at creating a computer controlled electromechanical ping pong game. The electronic components, game boards and development tools needed to realize the game will be handed out in the beginning of the semester. The main challenge will be to assemble the hardware components and develop software for the microcontrollers, making a fully functional embedded computer system that will enable you to play a refreshing game of ping pong.
